Ec2 â€“ An instances created to managed virtual servers for hosting the application.


The project involved creating an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline firstly manually and then
automated where code changes pushed to CodeCommit automatically and then
triggered the build process in CodeBuild. Upon successful builds, the artifacts get stored
in the S3 bucket and then the CodeDeploy automated the deployment of the
application to an EC2 instance.
